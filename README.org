#+TITLE: ansicl.info

Info version of the Draft ANSI Common Lisp standard, archived here for
easy use in the future.

The original text packaged here was taken from [[https://github.com/jwiegley/ready-lisp][John Wiegley's Ready Lisp repository]].

To use this, clone the repository and then add the following to your
emacs init file (make sure to change the ansicl repo directory):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Make sure emacs can find the info files
  (use-package info
    :config
    (info-initialize)
    (push "/Users/jeff/src/personal/ansicl.info/" Info-directory-list))

  ;; Also set up info-look so that you can easily search for lisp symbols
  (use-package info-look
    :config
    (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "<ansicl repo directory>")
    (info-lookup-add-help
     :mode 'lisp-mode
     :regexp "[^][()'\" \t\n]+"
     :ignore-case t
     :doc-spec '(("(ansicl)Symbol Index" nil nil nil))))
#+end_src

TODO: Figure out how to properly package this so this chicanery isn't necessary.
